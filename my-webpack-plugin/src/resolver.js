      // This is a bit of a performance hack. The short of it is that the way to checks for the
      // existence of a file in Node is by performing an fs operation (whether that's a `read`
      // or a `stat`). When this operation fails, an exception is created and thrown. Checking
      // the underlying OS error type in this exception can be used to determine whether the file
      // exists or some other error occurred.
      //
      // Node does this through an internal method called `uvException` - https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/307c67be175b8fe7d9dd9e1b5ed55d928b73d66d/lib/internal/errors.js#L399
      // (`libuv` being the underlying library that handles Node's async i/o). These exceptions
      // have a full stacktrace generated, which is actually a super expensive operation. Now
      // when we call `resolve` 20,000+ times during a webpack build we're generating a lot of
      // exceptions with stack traces that we just end up throwing away.
      //
      // So this hack noops the `captureStackTrace` method Node uses, and cuts the stack limit for
      // `new Error` calls. This means that errors occurring in this function won't have stack
      // traces, but this is an acceptable tradeoff for the almost 50% perf improvement we get
      // when we have a compile of significant size.
      //

      // easy optimization opportunities.
